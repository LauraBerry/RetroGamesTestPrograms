# Commodore VIC20 Test Programs

This is a collection of test programs for the Commodore VIC20.
Each has some use in the game we are making for our Retrogames course at the University of Calgary

## Test Program Listing
1. Clear the Screen
  * Testing that we can get control to transfer to an assembly program and back. This just clears the screen.
2. Fonts - Konrad
  * Get a bitmap font in memory with whatever characters/numbers we need. Print some strings.
3. Character Sprite - Yue
  * Draw a sprite on screen
4. Movable Sprite - Yue
  * Get a sprite to move around the screen when the user presses buttons.
5. Input Test - Andrew
  * Get input from the keyboard and/or the joystick
6. Score Display - Konrad
  * Show some numbers that can increment at the top of the screen. (Using bitmap fonts)
7. Sound Test - Andrew
  * Some subroutines for cool sound effects
8. Generate a Random Pattern of Lava - Konrad
  * Generates a grid pattern of tiles with a nice random distribution
9. Timing Test - Laura
  * Runs through three colors at set intervals, 3 seconds apart. Used for changing the game state.
10. Game Loop - Laura
  * Come up with some code for managing game state. Starting new games, ending games, keeping score, that sort of thing.
